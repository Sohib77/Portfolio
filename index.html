## Commentary on Usage and Revision

In revising my portfolio, I retained the professional format that the initial ChatGPT draft gave me but altered it to suit my personal background and what the assignment requested. I decided to omit such parts as Personal Interests, Certifications, and Leadership and Extracurricular Activities in order to remain focused on what was the most important. Rather, I have made clear and concise content that brings out my academic accomplishments, professional experience, and my strengths in order to make my portfolio really shine. I also changed the sequence of the parts and adjusted the words to simplify all the things and make them more effective. The changes assisted me in developing a portfolio that is both genuine to me as an MBA student and presentable in both academic and professional terms.
